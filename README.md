helium-etl-queries
==================

A collection of saved queries used to enrich the core data produced by an (blockchain-etl)[] and made available on

https://etl.dewi.org

Specifically creating and manging views that help surface the embedded JSON fields into a
more managable form, e.g. turning `transactions[type='state_channel_close']` => `data_credits` table with properly typed columns
